You are required to design and implement a Python program that finds the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
The program must allow the user to:
Input the number of edges.
Enter each edge in the form u v, where u and v are node names.
Automatically construct the graph using an adjacency list representation.
Input a start node and a goal node.
Run BFS to determine the shortest path (based on the minimum number of edges).
Print the path and the total number of steps.
If no path exists, the program must clearly notify the user.
The solution must handle invalid inputs (like missing nodes) and must correctly trace back the BFS parent links to reconstruct the shortest path.
